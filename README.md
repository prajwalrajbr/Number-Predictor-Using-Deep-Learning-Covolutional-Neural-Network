# Number-Predictor-Using-Deep-Learning-Covolutional-Neural-Network

This program is written for solving the MNIST Digit dataset. It allows the user to draw numbers on the screen and the program take a guess and Predicts the drawn Numbers. This uses a basic Convolutional Neural Network model.

# Requirements
- Python
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- Keras
- Tkinter

# Working ScreenShots

When user executes the program, the blank screen appears. Where the user can draw Numbers.

If the usert want to clear the screen, Right-Mouse-Button or Space-Bar is used.
After the user draws the Numbers, Enter [Return] is to be pressed.

Then the program predicts the Numbers.
